# Time_Puncher

Flutter project to monitor my work time, every day i have to scan my work card when entering office and leaving.

Its WIP so nothing works yet!

## My problem

I can't access personel data to manage my hours, so I don't know if I can leave earlier or have to stay longer.

Heres the solution, the app will track my location and save time stamps at the gate, where i scan my card.

I will also add some stats to check out.

also will allow tracking multiple places.
